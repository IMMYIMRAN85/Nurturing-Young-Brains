1. Save incoming video title + comments into a local file (e.g., JSON or text).
2. Start implementing basic NLP processing:
    - Detect profanity (bad words)
    - Detect hate speech, violence, or toxic language
3. Design backend APIs to analyze and return filtered results.
4. Display moderation reports inside the Chrome Extension popup or parental dashboard.
5. Later: Integrate a more advanced NLP model (e.g., BERT) for deeper analysis.
