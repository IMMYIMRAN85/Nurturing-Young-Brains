## ðŸ“‹ Next Development Steps

1. Save incoming video title + comments into a local file (e.g., JSON or text).
2. Implement basic NLP processing:
    - Detect profanity (bad words)
    - Detect hate speech, violence, or toxic language
3. If dangerous comments are detected:
    - Automatically send an email alert to parents, including:
      - Video Title
      - Detected Bad Comment
4. Design backend APIs to analyze and return filtered results.
5. Display moderation reports inside the Chrome Extension popup or parental dashboard.
6. Later: Integrate more advanced NLP models (e.g., BERT, VBM, SVM) for deeper analysis and intelligent classification.
